Crunchy Data announces the release of the [PostgreSQL Operator](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/crunchy-postgresql-operator/) 4.4.3 on March 1, 2021.

The PostgreSQL Operator is released in conjunction with the [Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/).

The PostgreSQL Operator 4.4.3 release includes the following software versions upgrades:

- The PostgreSQL containers now use versions 12.6, 11.11, 10.16, 9.6.21, and 9.5.25

PostgreSQL Operator is tested against Kubernetes 1.17 - 1.20, OpenShift 3.11, OpenShift 4.4+, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon EKS, Microsoft AKS, and VMware Enterprise PKS 1.3+, and works on other Kubernetes distributions as well.

## Changes

- When using the `--restore-from` option on `pgo create cluster` to create a new PostgreSQL cluster, the cluster bootstrap Job is now automatically removed if it completes successfully.
- The `--compress-type` flag is now supported for the backup options (`--backup-opts`) for pgBackRest backups with `pgo backup`. `none`, `gz`, `bz2`, and `lz4` are all supported. Presently `zst` is not supported.
- Add the `--no-prompt` flag to `pgo upgrade`. The mechanism to disable the prompt verification was already in place, but the flag was not exposed. Reported by (@devopsevd).
- Removes certain characters that causes issues in shell environments from consideration when using the random password generator, which is used to create default passwords or with `--rotate-password`.
- Allow for the `--link-map` attribute for a pgBackRest option, which can help with the restore of an existing cluster to a new cluster that adds an external WAL volume.
- Revert setting "UsePAM" to "yes" by default as the bug fix in Docker that required that change was applied roughly one year ago.

## Fixes

- Fix issue where `pgo test` would indicate every Service was a replica if the cluster name contained the word `replica` in it. Reported by Jose Joye (@jose-joye).
- Do not consider Evicted Pods as part of `pgo test`. This eliminates a behavior where faux primaries are considered as part of `pgo test`. Reported by Dennis Jacobfeuerborn (@dennisjac).
- Fix `pgo df` to not fail in the event it tries to execute a command within a dangling container from the bootstrap process when `pgo create cluster --restore-from` is used. Reported by Ignacio J.Ortega (@IJOL).
- `pgo df` will now only attempt to execute in running Pods, i.e. it does not attempt to run in evicted Pods. Reported by (@kseswar).
- Ensure the sync replication ConfigMap is removed when a cluster is deleted.
- Fix crash in shutdown logic when attempting to shut down a cluster where no primaries exist. Reported by Jeffrey den Drijver (@JeffreyDD).
- Fix syntax in recovery check command which could lead to failures when manually promoting a standby cluster. Reported by (@SockenSalat).
- Fix issue with pgo backup where it was unable to take a backup from a new primary after pgo failover was called. Reported by (@mesobreira).
- Do not trigger a backup if a standby cluster fails over. Reported by (@aprilito1965).
- Ensure `archive_mode` is forced to `on` when performing using the "restore in place" method. This ensures that the timeline is correctly incremented post-restore, which could manifest itself with various types of WAL archive failures.
- Generally improvements to initialization of a standby cluster.
- Ensure proper label parsing based on Kubernetes rules and that it is consistently applied across all functionality that uses labels. Reported by Jos√© Joye (@jose-joye).
- Remove legacy `defaultMode` setting on the volume instructions for the pgBackRest repo Secret as the `readOnly` setting is used on the mount itself. Reported by (@szhang1).
- Only attempts to start scheduled backups in running pgBackRest repository Pods. Reported by Satria Sahputra (@satriashp).
- Allow for `Restart` API server permission to be explicitly set. Reported by Aleksander Roszig (@AleksanderRoszig).
- Update `pgo-target` permissions to match expectations for modern Kubernetes versions.
- During a major upgrade, ensure permissions are correct on the old data directory before running `pg_upgrade`.
- Ensure major upgrades via `crunchy-upgrade` support PostgreSQL 12. Reported by (@lbartnicki92).
