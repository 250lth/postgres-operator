== PostgreSQL Operator Configuration
v1.0.0, {docdate}


This document describes the configuration options
for the *postgres operator*.

== pgo Client Configuration

There is a configuration file named *.pgo.yaml* for the operator client.  It
can be defined in the following locations:
 
 * . (current directory)
 * $HOME
 * /etc/pgo/

The .pgo.yaml file location is checked in that order.

== Operator Configuration (Server)

The operator is run as a Kube Deployment on the Kube cluster
within a namespace.  

The script *example/operator/run.sh* will create the operator
deployment on your Kube cluster.  

That script will also create a PV named *crunchy-pv* using a HostPath of */data*  and a PVC named *crunchy-pvc* on your local system.  This is 
only for testing the operator, edit or remove the PV/PVC creation
to meet your requirements.
