This document goes a bit deeper into the Crunchy Operator
design and explains the concepts fuller.

== Third Party Resources

Kubernetes Third Party Resources are used in the design
of the Crunchy Operator to define:

 * Database  - *crunchydatabases*
 * Cluster - *crunchyclusters*

A Database is made up of Pods and Services, whereas a Cluster is
made up of multiple Pods, Services, and Proxies.


=== Command Line Interface

The Crunchy command line interface (CLI) is used by a normal end-user
to create databases or clusters, or make changes to existing databases.

The CLI interacts interacts with the Kubernetes cluster using
the golang Kubernetes client package.  

When the CLI needs to create a new database, it does so by 
creating a new ThirdPartyResource of type *crunchydatabase*.
Likewise, the CLI can create a new cluster by creating
a new ThirdPartyResource instance of type *crunchycluster*.

From the CLI, users can view existing databases and clusters that
were deployed using the CLI and Operator.  Objects that were
not created by the Crunchy Operator are now viewable from the CLI.

=== Operator Deployment

The Crunchy Operator runs within a Pod Deployment in the Kubernetes
cluster.  An administrator will deploy the Crunchy Operator pod
using the provided script.  Once installed and running, the Operator
pod will start watching for certain defined events.

The operator watches for create/update/delete actions on 
the *crunchydatabase* and *crunchycluster* third party resources.  When
the CLI creates for example a new *crunchydatabase* third party
resource, the operator catches that event and creates pods and services
for that new database request.

=== CLI Design

The CLI uses the cobra package to implement CLI functionality
like help text, config file processing, and command line parsing.

=== Verbs

A user works with the CLI by entering verbs to indicate
what they want to do, as follows:
[source,bash]
----
crunchy show database all
crunchy delete database db1 db2 db3
crunchy create cluster mycluster
----

In the above example, the *show*, *backup*, *delete*, and *create* verbs are used.  The CLI is case sensitive and supports only lowercase.

=== Object Types

Currently the operator supports object types of *database* and *cluster*.
The object type follows the verb as follows:

[source,bash]
----
crunchy show database all
crunchy delete database db1 db2 db3
crunchy create cluster mycluster
----

== Debugging

Some tips on debugging the operator include the following:

To see if the operator pod is running enter the following:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pod -l 'name=crunchy-operator'
----

To verify the operator installed the following ThirdPartyResources:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get thirdpartyresources
----

You should see 3 crunchy third party resources deployed.

# Command Line Interface

You can view the  TPR Endpoints as follows:

[source,bash]
----
 curl https//192.168.42.30:8443/apis/crunchydata.com/v1/crunchydatabases --insecure
 curl https//192.168.42.30:8443/apis/crunchydata.com/v1/crunchyclusters --insecure
