== PostgreSQL Operator Deployment Strategies
v1.0.0, {docdate}


This document describes the various deployment strategies
offered by the operator.  A deployment in this case is 
the set of objects created in Kubernetes when a 
third party resource of type *pgdatabase* or *pgcluster* is created.
TPRs are created by the pgo client command and acted upon
by the postgres operator.

== Strategies

To support different types of deployments, the operator supports
multiple strategy implementations.  For Release 1.0, there is
only a default *database* strategy and a default *cluster* strategy.

In the future, more deployment strategies will be supported
to offer users more customization to what they see deployed
in their Kube cluster.

Being open source, users can also write their own strategy!

=== Specifying a Strategy

In the pgo client configuration file, there is a *DB.STRATEGY*
and *CLUSTER.STRATEGY* settings.  The current value of the
default strategy is *1*.  If you don't set that value, the
default strategy is assumed.  If you set that value to something
not supported, the operator will log an error.

=== Strategy Template Files

Each strategy supplies its set of templates used by the operator
to create new pods, services, etc.

When the operator is deployed, part of the deployment process
is to copy the required strategy templates into the mounted
volume (*/pgconf*) used by the operator pod.  See the
*examples/operator/run.sh* script for an example of this using
a HostPath PV/PVC.

The directory structure of the strategy templates is as 
follows:
....
├── backup-job.json
├── cluster
│   └── 1
│       ├── cluster-deployment.json
│       ├── cluster-replica-deployment.json
│       └── cluster-service.json
├── database
│   └── 1
│       ├── database-pod.json
│       ├── database-service.json
│       └── restore-database-pod.json
├── pvc.json
....

In this structure, each strategy's templates live in a subdirectory
that matches the strategy identifier.  The default strategy templates
are denoted by the value of *1* in the directory structure above.


== Default Database Deployment Strategy (1)

Using the default database strategy, a *database* when created by the operator will create the
following on a Kube cluster:

image::operator-diagram-database.png?raw=true[]

The default database strategy creates the following:

 * pod running Postgres container
 * service mapped to the Postgres container
 * PVC will be created if not specified in configuration

== Default Cluster Deployment Strategy (1)

Using the default cluster strategy, a *cluster* when created by the operator will create the
following on a Kube cluster:

image::operator-diagram-cluster.png?raw=true[]

The default cluster strategy creates the following:

 * deployment running a Postgres *master* container with replica count of 1
 * deployment running a Postgres *replica* container with replica count of 2
 * service mapped to the *master* Postgres database
 * service mapped to the *replica* Postgres database
 * PVC for the *master* will be created if not specified in configuration
