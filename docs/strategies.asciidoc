== PostgreSQL Operator Deployment Strategies
v1.0.0, {docdate}


This document describes the various deployment strategies
offered by the operator.  A deployment in this case is 
the set of objects created in Kubernetes when a 
third party resource of type database or cluster is created.
TPRs are created by the pgo client command.

== Strategies

There are different strategies for what pods and services
get created for a database and cluster.  Right now, the operator
supports only a default strategy for a database and cluster, but
in the future, more deployment strategies will be supported
to offer users more customization to what they see deployed
in their Kube cluster.

== Default Database Deployment Strategy

A *database* when created by the operator will create the
following on a Kube cluster:

The default database strategy creates the following:

 * pod running Postgres container
 * service mapped to the Postgres container
 * PVC will be created if not specified in configuration

== Default Cluster Deployment Strategy

A *cluster* when created by the operator will create the
following on a Kube cluster:

image::operator-diagram-cluster.png?raw=true[]

The default cluster strategy creates the following:

 * deployment running a Postgres *master* container with replica count of 1
 * deployment running a Postgres *replica* container with replica count of 2
 * service mapped to the *master* Postgres database
 * service mapped to the *replica* Postgres database
 * PVC for the *master* will be created if not specified in configuration
