== pgo.yaml

2.5 changed the pgo.yaml file in terms of storage configuration

=== Required Changes

You will need to change your pgo.yaml file to look like:
....
$COROOT/conf/apiserver/pgo.yaml
....

In terms of the Storage Configuration sections.

== Database Credentials Secrets

2.5 changed the names of the database credentials that are created
by default to get in sync with the way new database credentials 
were named.

=== Required Changes

There is a utility in :
....
$COROOT/bin/upgrade-secret.sh
....

that you will need to run on your existing clusters.  This script
will essentially copy the existing secrets values and create
new secrets with those same values but named to the new standard.

Run the script by passing in the name of a cluster as a parameter.
