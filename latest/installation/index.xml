      <description>For various scripts used by the Operator, the expenv utility is required as are certain environment variables.
Download the expenv utility from its Github Releases page, and place it into your PATH (e.g. $HOME/odev/bin).
The following environment variables are heavily used in the Bash installation procedures and may be used in Operator helper scripts.
   Variable Ansible Inventory Example Description     DISABLE_EVENTING pgo_disable_eventing false Disable Operator eventing subsystem   DISABLE_TLS pgo_disable_tls false Disable TLS for Operator   GOPATH  $HOME/odev Golang project directory   GOBIN  $GOPATH/bin Golang binary target directory   NAMESPACE namespace pgouser1 Namespaces monitored by Operator   PGOROOT  $GOPATH/src/github.</description>

      <description>Developing The Postgres-Operator is an open source project hosted on GitHub.
Developers that wish to build the Operator from source or contribute to the project via pull requests would set up a development environment through the following steps.
Create Kubernetes Cluster We use either OpenShift Container Platform or kubeadm to install development clusters.
Create a Local Development Host We currently build on CentOS 7 and RHEL 7 hosts. Others operating systems are possible, however we do not support building or running the Operator on other operating systems at this time.</description>
